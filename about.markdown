# Timeline

2015: Started college at the Kansas Academy of Mathematics and Science, and knocked down a lot of advanced math and chemistry, but graduated with a C-average GPA.  I did manage to get some experience as a Data Analyst for the High Altitude Balloon club during that time.

2017: Moved to Seattle to help a friend relocate, and spent time at a couple temporary data analyst positions. Started working at Amazon and getting my degree in supply chain in 2019-2023.

2021: Rediscovered my passion for mathematics, taking some of the advanced math courses I couldn't squeeze in first round of college.  Started working on evolution simulations and other kinds of computational art while I relearned Python.

Mid-2022: Discovered artificial intelligence and became deeply fascinated with the field.  That's when I started reading several ML/neuroscience papers a day, and working through the seminol books in AI.

Spring 2023: Relocated back to Kansas to start at the University of Kansas to complete prerequisite classes for my master's.  I had a great time with the AI organization there and met my first friends in the ML-space.

Fall 2023: Began my master's at the University of Kansas Medical Center, absolutely dedicating myself to neuroscience and machine learning research.  There I put in a massive amount of work to launch the first hands-on AI organization and secured great mentors in machine learning.

November 2024: Secured a position as an advanced Research Analyst at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, where I'm happy to be learning a lot about data science and machine learning.
